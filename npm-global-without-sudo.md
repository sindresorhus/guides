# Install `npm` packages globally without sudo on macOS and Linux

`npm` installs packages locally within your projects by default. You can also install packages globally (e.g. `npm install -g <package>`) (useful for command-line apps). However the downside of this is that you need to be root (or use `sudo`) to be able to install globally.

Here is a way to install packages globally for a given user.

###### 1. Create a directory for global packages

```sh
mkdir "${HOME}/.npm-packages"
```

###### 2. Indicate to `npm` where to store globally installed packages. In your `~/.npmrc` file add:

```sh
prefix=${HOME}/.npm-packages
```

###### 3. Ensure `npm` will find installed binaries and man pages. Add the following to your `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`:

```sh
NPM_PACKAGES="${HOME}/.npm-packages"

PATH="$NPM_PACKAGES/bin:$PATH"

# Unset manpath so we can inherit from /etc/manpath via the `manpath` command
unset MANPATH # delete if you already modified MANPATH elsewhere in your config
export MANPATH="$NPM_PACKAGES/share/man:$(manpath)"
```

NOTE: If you are running macOS, the `.bashrc` file may not yet exist, and the terminal will be obtaining its environment parameters from another file, such as `.profile` or `.bash_profile`. These files also reside in the user's home folder. In this case, simply adding the following line to them will instruct Terminal to also load the `.bashrc` file:

```sh
source ~/.bashrc
```
