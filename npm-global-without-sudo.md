# Install `npm` packages globally without sudo on macOS and Linux

`npm` installs packages locally within your projects by default. You can also install packages globally (e.g. `npm install -g <package>`) (useful for command-line apps). However the downside of this is that you need to be root (or use `sudo`) to be able to install globally.

Here is a way to install packages globally for a given user.

###### 1. Create a directory for global packages

```sh
mkdir "${HOME}/.npm-packages"
```

###### 2. Tell `npm` where to store globally installed packages

```sh
npm config set prefix "${HOME}/.npm-packages"
```

###### 3. Ensure `npm` will find installed binaries and man pages

Add the following to your `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`:

```sh
NPM_PACKAGES="${HOME}/.npm-packages"

export PATH="$PATH:$NPM_PACKAGES/bin"

# Preserve MANPATH if you already defined it somewhere in your config.
# Otherwise, fall back to `manpath` so we can inherit from `/etc/manpath`.
export MANPATH="${MANPATH-$(manpath)}:$NPM_PACKAGES/share/man"
```

If you're using `fish`, add the following to `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```sh
set NPM_PACKAGES "$HOME/.npm-packages"

set PATH $PATH $NPM_PACKAGES/bin

set MANPATH $NPM_PACKAGES/share/man $MANPATH  
```

If you have erased your MANPATH by mistake, you can restore it by running `set -Ux MANPATH (manpath -g) $MANPATH` once. Do not put this command in your `config.fish`.

Check out [`npm-g_nosudo`](https://github.com/glenpike/npm-g_nosudo) for doing the above steps automagically

NOTE: If you are running macOS, the `.bashrc` file may not yet exist, and the terminal will be obtaining its environment parameters from another file, such as `.profile` or `.bash_profile`. These files also reside in the user's home folder. In this case, simply adding the following line to them will instruct Terminal to also load the `.bashrc` file:

```sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

NOTE2: If you are using the various versions of `nvm` (Node Version Manager) for switching Node releases, most (if not all) of these libraries avoid this issue by default as they install Node and global packages in their own folders. For example https://github.com/jorgebucaran/nvm.fish doesn't need `sudo` when using `npm i -g <package>` and it can also automatically preinstall global packages for each Node version using `set --universal nvm_default_packages package1 package2 ...`.
