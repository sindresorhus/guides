# How not to `rm` yourself

The [`rm`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rm_\(Unix\)) command is inherently dangerous and should not be used directly. It can at worst let you accidentally remove **everything**. Here's how you can protect *you* from yourself.

## Use `trash`

The `trash` command-line tool will move stuff to the trash instead of permanently deleting it. You should not alias `rm` to `trash` as it will break external scripts relaying on the behavior of `rm`. Instead use it directly: `trash image.jpg`.

#### OS X

Use [`trash`](http://hasseg.org/trash/) instead of `rm`:

```
brew install trash
```

#### Linux

Use [`trash-cli`](https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli) instead of `rm`:

```
apt-get install trash-cli
```

#### Windows

Use [`recycle`](http://techie-buzz.com/softwares/recycle-files-from-windows-command-prompt.html).


## Safeguard `rm`

Even though you don't use `rm` directly, external scripts most likely will. There are some things you can do to safeguard this:

- Alias `rm` to its interactive mode, which will force you to step through what it's trying to delete: `alias rm="rm -i"`

- Install `coreutils` which includes a newer version of `rm` with the flag `--preserve-root` which is enabled by default and will prevent you from removing root.
	OS X: `brew install coreutils`
	Linux: `apt-get install coreutils`

	With this version of `rm` you can also choose to switch from `alias rm="rm -i"` to `alias rm="rm -I"` which is similar:

	> -I   prompt once before removing more than three files, or when removing recursively. Less intrusive than -i, while still giving protection against most mistakes.

- Install [`safe-rm`](http://www.safe-rm.org.nz) which will let you set off-limits directories.

- ZSH users can also do the following:
	- Put `unsetopt RM_STAR_SILENT` in your .zshrc, which will make it ask you before executing `rm` with a star `rm folder/*`.

	- Put `setopt RM_STAR_WAIT` in your .zshrc, which will make it wait 10 seconds until executing `rm` with a star `rm folder/*`.
